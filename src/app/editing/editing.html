        <p>I have been a freelance fiction editor on Fiverr since November, 2024. Since then, I have completed <b>more than 50 orders</b> and maintained a <b>4.9 star rating.</b> I've also hit Level 2 on the platform, which is the second highest seller rank!</p>
        <br>
        <p>I specialize in fiction of all genres, especially literary fiction, fantasy, romance, fairytales, young adult, horror, and speculative fiction.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I have experience writing and editing flash fiction, short stories, and novels.</p>

        <p>I don't actually make that much money doing freelance editing. Fiverr takes <b>20%</b> of my earnings on top of the fees taken from the client. I also spend a lot of time on each piece and make a decent living at my day job. I edit mostly because I love it, and because I want to keep my editing skills sharp.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I'm happy to edit anything under 20k words. For longer projects, I want to be just as passionate about it as you are. Feel free to message me on Fiverr if you have any questions or requests.</p>
