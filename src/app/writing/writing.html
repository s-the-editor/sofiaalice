                <p>The story follows Lenora, an infamous necromancer, from childhood to adulthood. As a child, she discovers her powers in the wastes of Nyvaris. As a young adult, she travels to Zephria to attend the School of Magecraft at the University of Aurelith. She becomes a celebrated wizard and joins the newly-created Wardens of Aurelith to protect her new country from rogue sorcery.

                <p>The novel explores themes of how the narrative surrounding mythic figures is controlled by the dominant culture; the necessity of love, friendship, and relationships in adult fantasy; and the importance of diversity in scholarship.
