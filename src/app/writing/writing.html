            <h3>Saga of the Necromancer</h3>
            <p><i>Saga of the Necromancer</i> is a high fantasy novel in its first draft. It currently sits at about 50k words.</p>
            <p>The story follows Lenora, an infamous necromancer, from childhood to adulthood. As a child, she discovers her powers in the wastes of Nyvaris. As a young adult, she travels to Zephria to attend the School of Magecraft at the University of Aurelith. She becomes a celebrated wizard and joins the newly-created Wardens of Aurelith to protect her new country from rogue sorcery. Though she finds love and friendship in the Wardens, she slowly realizes that they don't fight for goodness, but the interests of a charismatic but ill-intentioned king.</p>
            <p>The novel explores themes of how the narrative surrounding mythic figures is controlled by the dominant culture; the necessity of love, friendship, and relationships in adult fantasy; and the importance of diversity in scholarship. Above all, it's a story about magic, strong women, and adventure.</p>
